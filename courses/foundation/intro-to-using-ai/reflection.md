Three risks of relying too much on AI tools at HackYourFuture
1. Three new things I learned from AI:
    -How to write clearer prompts for better results.
    -How AI can explain code step by step.
    -Different ways to solve the same coding problem.

2. Where I had to tweak Copilot’s suggestions:
    -I had to fix logic errors, rename variables, 
    and adjust the code to fit my project needs.

3. Copilot as a code generator vs. learning partner:
    -As a generator, it writes code for you.
    -As a learning partner, it helps you understand and improve your own code.

4. Three risks of relying too much on AI:
    -You might not fully understand what you’re doing.
    -Your problem-solving skills can weaken.
    -You could end up using code that isn’t really yours.
