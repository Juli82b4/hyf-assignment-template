For the filling:

600 g (21 oz) cream cheese, room temperature

150 g (¾ cup) sugar

200 ml (¾ cup) sour cream or heavy cream

3 large eggs

🍳 Instructions

Preheat oven to 160°C (320°F).
Line the bottom of a 9-inch (23 cm) springform pan with parchment paper.

Make the crust:

Combine crushed biscuits, melted butter, and sugar (if using).

Press mixture firmly into the bottom of the pan.

Bake for 10 minutes, then set aside to cool.

Make the filling:

Beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth (about 2 minutes).

Add sour cream, vanilla, lemon zest, and juice; mix until creamy.

Add eggs one at a time, mixing on low speed after each addition.

(Optional: Mix in flour for a denser texture.)

Assemble:

Pour filling over the crust.

Tap the pan lightly to remove air bubbles.

Bake:

Bake for 50–60 minutes, until the center is slightly wobbly.

Turn off the oven, crack the door open, and let the cheesecake cool inside for 1 hour (this prevents cracks).

Chill:

Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight before serving.

Serve:

Top with berries, fruit sauce, or a drizzle of chocolate or caramel.
