🍳 Instructions
Step 1: Preheat & prepare pans

Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F).

Grease and line two 9-inch (23 cm) round cake pans with parchment paper.

Step 2: Mix dry ingredients

In a bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, salt, and cocoa powder.

Step 3: Mix wet ingredients

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together oil, sugar, eggs, buttermilk, red food coloring, vinegar, and vanilla until smooth.

Step 4: Combine

Gradually add the dry mixture into the wet, mixing just until combined (don’t overmix).

Step 5: Bake

Divide the batter evenly between pans.

Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.

Let cool in pans for 10 minutes, then remove and cool completely on a wire rack.

Step 6: Make the frosting

Beat cream cheese and butter together until creamy (2–3 minutes).

Add vanilla and salt.

Gradually add powdered sugar, beating until smooth and fluffy.

Step 7: Assemble

Place one cake layer on a plate, spread frosting evenly.

Top with the second layer, then frost the top and sides.

Chill for 30 minutes before slicing for cleaner cuts.
